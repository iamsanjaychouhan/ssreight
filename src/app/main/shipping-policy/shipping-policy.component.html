            <p class="fontsize-14 color-black mb-30">"Availability". Every product detail's page will show a value similar to "Usually Ships in 24 Working Hours". Weekly holidays and other Festive/National 
                    Holidays considered as non working hours, It is also noted in the Shopping Cart, and informs you of how quickly an item will be ready to ship out. For 
                    example, some items will ship within 24 hours, others in a couple days, while some may take as many as several weeks (especially custom products). 
                    The "Availability" value is an estimate. We do our best to ship items out as quickly as possible, so we often get orders out more quickly than is noted 
                    by the "Availability" timeframe, but please do not count on that.
